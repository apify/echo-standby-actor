## Echo Standby Actor

Echo Standby Actor is an example implementation of an Actor using [Standby mode](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/standby). It implements a simple HTTP server that responds with the request headers, method, body, and query parameters - it echoes the request. The Actor behaves as a standard API server with automatic scaling based on pending requests. For more information about Actor Standby, see (the documentation)[https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/standby].
